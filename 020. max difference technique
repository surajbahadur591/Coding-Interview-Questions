max difference technique

given an array of stock price what is the best time to sell stock to gain max profit with only one trade

find max difference such that large element comes after small element

keep track of small element before current element, then find out difference

int maxDiff(a):
    minSoFar = -infinity
    maxTrade = 0
    for i in a:
        minSoFar = min (a[i], minSoFar)
        max_profit_at_i = a[i]- minSoFar
        if(max_profit_at_i>maxTrade):
            maxTrade = max_profit_at_i
    return maxTrade
