make three state - unvisited, visiting, visisted
initially all nodes are unvisited
process:
    visit each unvisited neighbour
    mark visisted
    

dfs_visit (node):
    mark node_visiting
    process node //ex : print

for all nodes in graph:
    mark unvisited
for all nodes in graph:
    if node is unvisited:
        dfs_visit(node)
