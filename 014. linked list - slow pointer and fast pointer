linked list - slow pointer and fast pointer

find if linked list has a cycle or not

algo :
boolean findCycle(){
while (fast != null){
      fast+1;
      if (fast== slow) return true;
      fast+1;
      if (fast== slow) return true;
      slow+1;
}
return false;
} 

linked hashtable
hashtable is a key value pair 
every value of each key in hashtable points to each node of linked list
advantage : O(n) lookup

ex: LRU [least recently used] cache problem

reverse a linked list [banned question for interview]

prev, curr, next

while (curr!=null){
      curr.next = prev;
      prev = curr;
      curr = next;
      next = curr.next;
      
}
