BST

binary search in binary tree

node level property : left.node < parent, parent > right.node
tree level property : left subtree nodes are always less than root and right subtree nodes are always greater than root

find given binary tree is BST

adding a node

deleting a node 
1. delete a node
2. node has 1 child
3. node has  2 child
    find successor - left most child of right subtree

problem - find next successor

it can be left most child of right subtree or first parent of current node to the right or last node of tree

building BST
1. from sorted array
2. from sorted linked list
