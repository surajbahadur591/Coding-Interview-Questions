sorting algorithms 

O(n2)
insertion sort
bubble sort
selection sort 

O(nlogn)
mergersort
quicksort

special use case
bucketsort
radixsort


merge sort (divide and conquer algorithms)

sort 1st half
sort 2nd half
merge

merge sorted array
[1,2,4,7,8] , [2,3,5]

result = [1,2,3,4,5,7,8]
solve in O(n) time and  O(n) space
solve using two pointer

quick sort [inplace algorithms]
default sort function in any language uses quicksort
worstcase is O(n2) and average case is O(nlogn)

pigeonhole sort ( bucket sort)
