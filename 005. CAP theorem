CAP theorem

consistency - Availablity - Partition Tolerance : any distribution DB is trade off between these three 

consistency:
if there are more than 1 DB , if one of database gets updated then the same should be updated in all other databases

to achieve this feature the first database should writes to other database and only after the other databases is updated (aknowledgement is recieved)then only the first database gets updated.
the tradeoff is , it took longer time to get updated because we have to make round trip to other database

some requires low consistency like notification, like button
some requires high consistency like prices, e-commerce website, bank etc


Availablity :  
the system gives non error response everytime
suppose if the database is getting updated for x sec, the client should wait and try again after some time


partition Tolerance : the system continues to operate in spite of network partition
if there is only one DB there is no concept of partition Tolerance
