bfs - basics 
also used for level order

s
1 -> 2
|d   |d
3 -> 4
|d   |d 
5 -> 6

bfs - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

make three state - unvisited, visiting, visisted
initially all nodes are unvisited

bfs (Node start):
    q.push(start)
    start -> visiting
    while !q.empty:
        current = q.pop()
        process current // ex print
        add unvisited neighbour to queue and mark them visiting (2.3)
        current -> visisted

process:
    visit each unvisited neighbour
    mark visisted
