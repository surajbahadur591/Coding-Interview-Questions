heaps 

max heap, min heap

max heaps are binary tree such that parent > child, root is the greatest element
O(1) lookup for maximum element in tree i.e used for implemention of priority queue
O(logn) to insert element
O(logn) to delete element


min heap are binary tree such that child > parent and root is the smallest element
O(1) lookup for minimum element in tree
O(logn) to insert element
O(logn) to delete element

find the 4 smallest numbers in an array

heap - implementation
    
    A
  B    C
 D  E   F

  a = {A , B , C , D, E,F}

left[i] = 2*i+1
right[i] = 2*i+2
parent[i] = [i-1]/2

operation - insert, delete max, delete any node
note : heaps are complete binary tree
insert(node)
add element to last then propogate, swap root with leaf

delete max()
place last leftmost leaf to top root, then heapify 
last element
heapify(node){
    max (left, right, node)
    if(max!=node)
        heapify(max)
}

delete any node
place last node from right sub tree to deleted node
then if replaced_node < either of children then heapify(node)
if node > parent then propogate
