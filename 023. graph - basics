graph - basics

nodes, vertices
directed , undirected graph 
graphs has cyclic, trees dont have cyclic

we can implement graph using 
1. adjacent list [most common way]
2. adjacent matrix

adjacent list 
A - {B,C}
B - {C, D}

class Node {
    list <Node> neighbour;
    int data;
}
class Graph {
    List<Node> nodes;
}


adjacent matrix 

 A B C D 
A1 1 1 0
B1 0 0 1
C1 1 1 0
D0 1 1 0
