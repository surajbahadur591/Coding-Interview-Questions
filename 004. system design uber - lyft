Load Balancer :

mobile <-> Internet <-> Load Balancer <-> App servers -> Distributed DB

App Servers - handles requests (HTTP)
load Balancer - assigns requests from mobile to app servers
    -> picks app servers
    -> forward requests to app servers
    -> recieve response from app servers
    -> forward response to client 
Benifits 
    -> improves response time (gives requests to app servers which is not busy)
    -> improves fault tolerance (if one app servers fails, send requests to another app servers)
    -> hides internal servers (security)
    -> handles failure
